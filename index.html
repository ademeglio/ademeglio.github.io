                <p>Hi! My name is Anthony J. DeMeglio,<br>
                full stack developer in training.<br>
                Welcome to my little spot<br>
                on the internet.</p>
            </div>
        </header>

        <main>
            <section id="aboutMe">
                <h2>about(<span class="myName">me</span>) {</h2>
                
                <p>I wasn’t always a developer. For over a decade, 
                    I had been designing lighting for events and corporate meetings. 
                    Having first studied and trained at the <em>University of North Carolina 
                    School of the Arts</em> which gave me the not only a design background 
                    but the skills necessary to work, plan and execute large scale 
                    projects under intense pressure. This allowed me to succeed also 
                    as a production and project manager where I coordinated the different 
                    aspects that make up a production including audio, video, scenery, 
                    decor, catering and the many other parts needed to create a successful 
                    event.
                </p>
                <p>I love the creative process and figuring out how to put the puzzle pieces 
                    together,  the process of partnering with my clients and various teams to 
                    ultimately give the guests an experience to remember.
                </p>
                <p>Now, as I work my way through the WeCanCodeIT coding bootcamp, I’m learning 
                    new skills that still relate to the work I’ve done for so many years. Coding 
                    is my new puzzle and I still have the opportunity to work in a creative team 
                    environment as we look for solutions for our clients. I am able to apply my 
                    detail oriented and analytical skills to find creative solutions to complex 
                    problems. I am able to manage multiple projects in a deadline-driven environment 
                    without breaking a sweat and work with other people to troubleshoot and debug issues.
                </p>
                <p>When I’m not solving challenges at work, I’m enjoying time with my awesome family. 
                    When time permits, I enjoy photography, house projects and I’m currently building a kit car!

                        <h3>My first blog post for programming!</h3>
                        <span>June 22, 2018</span>
                        <p>Hi! I'm so happy that you stopped by. In the age of WordPress and 
                            Blogger, <em>That's still a thing, right?</em>, I decided to write my 
                            blog the old fashioned way. That's right, I'm using plain old
                            HTML. I think it's a great way to work on my HTML chops.
                        </P>
                        <p>My hope with this blog is to share the fun new programming knowledge and skills I have
                            gaining with the <a href="https://wecancodeit.com">WeCanCodeIT</a> Flexcode&trade; 
                            bootcamp that I am fortunate to have been sent to by my current employer,
                            <a href="https://bartha.com">Bartha</a>. The end goal is for me to be able
                            to write custom applications for the company. While the training is for 
                            Junior Developer position, I'll be needing to step up to Senior Developer once
                            the course is complete.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, at this point we are few weeks into the course and after having spent a few weeks
                            learning Java, we're currently working on learning front-end languages such as HTML, 
                            CSS, and Flexbox. I'm looking forward to diving into some JavaScript and everthing 
                            else they have planned for us! 
                        </p>
