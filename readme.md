# Professional Portfolio
## Overview
Create a portfolio site highlighting your work that can be shared with potential employers. Focus first on building a good structure, then later style and lay out with with CSS.

## Tasks
First, set up your _username_.github.io site as per the instructions at https://pages.github.com.

### Build the document structure
* Create a main page (`index.html`) representing a professional portfolio, including the following:

  * an appropriate `<header>` element
  * a `<nav>` element linking to each of the sections
  * an `<h1>` element with your page title (there can be only one)
  * a `<section>` element for each of the following, each of which should contain an appropriate heading element:
    * About Me, consisting of:
      * brief biographical information
      * photo
      * contact information
      * links to your professional networking site profiles, including at least GitHub and LinkedIn
      * list of skills

      Include whatever other information you consider pertinent.

    * Projects, consisting of at least three, each represented as an `<article>`
      * name of project, linked to GitHub repository or the repository/project’s GitHub Pages
      * screenshot
      * skills / technologies used

      Don’t worry that your available projects are limited now. You’ll have time to increase the size of your portfolio.

  * an appropriate `<footer>` element
### Lay out and style your portfolio
* Assign ids/classes to sections/etc, then use css grid to lay out your page. Reference MDN and this tutorial to work out how to use grid: http://cssgridgarden.com/
*  To contain the elements of your grid, you will want to create a `<div>`, something like `<div id="container">...</div>`.
* Create CSS rules to style page elements appropriately.
### Using online resources
Any resources (images, etc) you use should be:

* free for non-commercial use
* copied to your repository and referenced there rather than via a uri pointing to another site
## Rubric
## Tips
* Section ids can be used to create anchors linking to those sections inside the page.
* See the appropriate Mozilla Developer Network reference pages for guidance regarding tag usage:
  * <header>
  * <nav>
  * <section>
  * <article>
  * <footer>
